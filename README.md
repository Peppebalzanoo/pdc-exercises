# Parallel and Distributed Computing Project Overview

This series of projects explores core concepts of parallel computing through practical exercises utilizing different architectures and programming models. Each project focuses on solving computational problems in parallel environments, demonstrating the efficiency gains and challenges associated with distributed and shared memory systems.

## Exercise : Sum of N Numbers with MIMD-DM using MPI
This project tackles the "Sum of N Numbers" problem in a parallel computing environment utilizing a Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data (MIMD) architecture with Distributed Memory (DM). The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is employed to coordinate communication between processes distributed across multiple nodes.

## Exercise 2: Sum of N Numbers with MIMD-SM using OpenMP
In this exercise, the "Sum of N Numbers" problem is approached using a MIMD architecture with Shared Memory (SM). OpenMP is used to parallelize the computation, leveraging shared resources to increase processing speed within a single multi-core machine.

## Exercise 3: Matrix by Matrix Product with MIMD-DM using MPI
This project focuses on solving the "Matrix by Matrix Product" problem in a distributed memory environment using MPI. Processes run independently on different nodes, communicating results to compute the matrix product efficiently across a MIMD-DM system.
